/*Given a non-negative integer N. The task is to check if N is a power of 2. More formally, check if N can be expressed as 2x for some x.

Example 1:

Input: N = 1
Output: YES
Explanation:1 is equal to 2 
raised to 0 (20 = 1).
Example 2:

Input: N = 98
Output: NO
Explanation: 98 cannot be obtained
by any power of 2.

Your Task:Your task is to complete the function isPowerofTwo() which takes n as a parameter and returns true or false by checking if the given number can be represented as a power of two or not.

Expected Time Complexity:O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space:O(1).

Constraints:
0 â‰¤N â‰¤1018*/
